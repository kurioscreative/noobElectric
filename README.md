# noobElectric
This is a project to build basic Electrical Engineering 
Python modules for use by beginers and experienced pros a like!

###Topics Covered (now or hopefully)
* Ohms law
* Receiver Operator Characteristics
* Quantization error in ADC
* Stokes Parameters
* Gaussian Beams

###Background
Although there are many different scientific computing packages available
for Python, none quite satisfy the more theoretical calculations associated
with common EE investigations. For instance we will not try and recreate the 
Fast Fourier Transform, which has been implemented numerous times, but rather
create an ohms law function that can quickly give you the voltage off a resistor.

This is an attempt to create common modules that can be useful for either 
simple or complex 'everyday' applications.  Starting from the classroom, and
branching out into real world applications, this project aims to help the 
creator (Nicholas Ericksen) and hopefully others learn about/solve EE
related problems. 

At the end of the day we are all noobs...with much more to learn.
